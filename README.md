# World Cup 2026

Predictive modeling, simulation, evaluation, and static-site assets for the FIFA
World Cup 2026 project developed around EMAp/FGV work on football forecasting.

The repository covers the full pipeline from international match data to published
probability tables: data download and preparation, Bayesian Stan models,
frequentist Dixon-Coles models, Monte Carlo tournament simulators, validation
scripts for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, generated CSV/JSON/HTML outputs, and
the public static website under `docs/`.

## What This Repository Does

This project estimates national-team strength from recent international match
results and uses those estimates to simulate World Cup tournaments. The main
outputs are:

- qualification and title probabilities by team;
- match-level scoreline probabilities;
- bracket probability exports for each knockout phase;
- model comparison outputs such as Brier score tables and plots;
- HTML dashboards and a Portuguese static site for the public-facing project.

There are two modeling tracks in the repo:

- **Bayesian (Stan)**: `stan_models/` + `src/data/loader.py` + `src/model/bayesian.py`
  + `src/tournament/bayesian.py` + `src/simulations/` — full Bayesian posterior
  workflow with CmdStan, draws saved as compressed NumPy files.
- **Frequentist (Dixon-Coles)**: `src/model/frequentist.py` + `src/tournament/frequentist.py`
  — maximum-likelihood fitting with L-BFGS-B for fast iteration and export.

## Source Package Structure

`src/` is a proper Python package. All imports use the `src.*` namespace.

### `src/constants.py`

Central constants: data paths, tournament weights, 2026 groups, bracket rules,
score labels, team-name mappings (`TEAM_MAP_EN_TO_PT`, `TEAM_MAP_PT_TO_EN`), and
display labels.

## Stan Model Track

The Bayesian workflow uses `.stan` files in `stan_models/`, prepares weighted
match data with `src.data.loader`, runs CmdStan through `cmdstanpy`, saves
posterior draws to `data/outputs/models/`, and simulates tournaments from those
draws using `BayesianWorldCup2026`.

The model names encode two choices:

- `poisson` vs. `dc`: independent Poisson scoring vs. Dixon-Coles low-score correction.
- `ranking` vs. `noranking`: whether FIFA ranking information is included as a prior-strength feature.
- `n_` vs. `st_`: normal vs. Student-t style parameterization in the Stan model family.

The production model for 2026 is `n_poisson_ranking`.

## Data

The project uses the
[International Football Results from 1872 to 2026](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/martj42/international-football-results-from-1872-to-2017)
dataset from Kaggle. The upstream dataset name mentions 2017, but the dataset is
updated over time. Three files are expected:

| File | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `results.csv` | International match results with teams, scores, tournament, venue, and neutrality fields. |
| `shootouts.csv` | Penalty shootout outcomes. |
| `goalscorers.csv` | Individual goal-scoring records. |

Additional project data includes:

- `data/world_cup_results.csv`: 2026 schedule/results file used to fix known
  World Cup results and detect the current phase.
- `data/summary.csv`: current public probability summary by team.
- `data/probs_*.csv`: match-level probability exports for the current or named phase.
- `data/chaveamento_probs.csv`: bracket probability export.
- `data/raw/fifa_ranking_*.csv`: ranking inputs used as Stan priors.
- `docs/csv/previsoes/*.csv`: website-facing copies of prediction and bracket data.

## Setup

### macOS / Linux

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd WorldCup2026
make local
```

### Windows PowerShell

```powershell
git clone <repo-url>
cd WorldCup2026
.\setup.ps1
```

Both setup paths install `uv`, install the Python version from `.python-version`,
create a virtual environment, install dependencies, and set up pre-commit hooks.

For Stan workflows, ensure CmdStan is installed and accessible to `cmdstanpy`.
The repository includes a compiled binary for `n_poisson_ranking` in `stan_models/`,
but it is a platform-specific artifact and may need to be rebuilt locally.

## Common Commands

| Task | macOS/Linux | Windows PowerShell |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Setup | `make local` | `.\setup.ps1` |
| Lint and typecheck | `make check` | `uv run ruff check src/; uv run mypy src/` |
| Format | `make format` | `uv run ruff format src/` |
| Run pre-commit hooks | `make test` | `uv run pre-commit run --all-files` |
| Download Kaggle data | `make run-data` | `uv run python -c "from src.data.loader import data_pipeline; data_pipeline()"` |
| Update chances page | `make update-chances` | `uv run python src/output/export.py --wc-results data/world_cup_results.csv` |
| Clean generated caches | `make clean` | Remove `.venv`, cache folders, and build artifacts manually |

## Key Entry Points

```bash
# 1. Download / refresh Kaggle match data
make run-data

# 2. Train the 2026 Bayesian (Stan) model
uv run python -m src.simulations.train_2026

# 3. Simulate 2026 from saved Stan posterior draws (writes JSON, CSVs, dashboard)
uv run python -m src.simulations.sim_2026

# 4. Re-train and re-simulate after new match results are recorded
#    (edit data/world_cup_results.csv first, then run:)
uv run python -m src.simulations.update_2026

# 5. Export current-phase score probabilities and update docs/chances.html
uv run python src/output/export.py --wc-results data/world_cup_results.csv

# 6. Train / evaluate Stan models for 2018 and 2022 validation cycles
uv run python -m src.model_sel.validate
uv run python -m src.model_sel.evaluate_2018
uv run python -m src.model_sel.evaluate_2022
```

The active Stan scripts and shared modules use standardized English variable and
function names. Portuguese labels, output filenames, and website-facing paths
such as `docs/csv/previsoes/` are kept as part of the public static-site contract.

## Website

The public site lives in `docs/` and is written as static HTML/CSS/JavaScript in
Portuguese. It includes:

- `docs/index.html`: project landing page;
- `docs/modelos.html`: model descriptions;
- `docs/previsoes.html`: match predictions;
- `docs/chances.html`: team advancement/title chances;
- `docs/calendario.html`: schedule page;
- `docs/vis.html`: retrospective visualizations;
- `docs/equipe.html`: team page;
- `docs/midia.html`: media page;
- `docs/album.html`: team album page;
- `docs/css/`, `docs/js/`, `docs/images/`, and `docs/csv/`: styling, behavior,
  assets, and data consumed by the pages.

Because the site is static, it can be viewed by opening `docs/index.html` in a
browser or by serving `docs/` with any static server.

## Generated Outputs

Several files in `data/`, `docs/csv/`, and `data/outputs/` are generated by the
training and simulation scripts. In particular:

- model draw files: `data/outputs/models/*.npz`;
- simulation JSON: `data/outputs/results/sim_results_*.json`;
- dashboards: `data/outputs/dashboards/dashboard_*.html`;
- public probability tables: `data/summary.csv`,
  `docs/csv/previsoes/partidas.csv`, `docs/csv/previsoes/summary.csv`, and
  `docs/csv/previsoes/chaveamento_probs.csv`;
- evaluation tables and plots: `data/outputs/results/brier_score_*.csv` and
  `data/outputs/results/comparacao_brier_*.png`.

When changing the modeling code, regenerate the relevant outputs before updating
the website.

## Notes for Contributors

- Keep source changes in `src/` and `stan_models/` separate from generated
  output changes when possible.
- Use `data/world_cup_results.csv` to add known 2026 match results and let
  `src.simulations.update_2026` propagate changes into summaries and site files.
- Run formatting and checks (`make check`) before committing source changes.
- Treat `2022Cup/` as an archive unless intentionally maintaining the legacy
  2022 site or simulations.
